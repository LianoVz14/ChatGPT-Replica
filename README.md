Feel free to explore the application and test out its features!

## Features

- **Predefined Questions & Auto-Response**: A list of predefined questions is automatically generated. When any of these questions is clicked, the bot will respond with a relevant answer. You can also just type the predefined questions manually
- **Random Default Responses**: If the user's question does not match any of the predefined ones, the bot will reply with random, default responses such as "I'm not sure about that" or "Can you rephrase your question?" to maintain the conversation flow.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Simulated conversational responses based on predefined patterns and algorithms.
- **Real-time Conversation**: Seamless communication with instant responses for an engaging chat experience.
